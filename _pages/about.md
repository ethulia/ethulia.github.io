I'm Ming. I live in San Francisco and am interested in software and Internet culture. I was most recently Head of Product at [Lattice](https://www.lattice.com), and before that worked in [engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiHlVVLOW2w) & product at [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com).

**Side Projects:**
- This website!  
- [Papertrail](https://www.papertrail.cc), a way to share and discover interesting things to read on the internet. Think Goodreads for articles.

Other places that you can find me on the internet: [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ming), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minglu1), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/m1nglu).
