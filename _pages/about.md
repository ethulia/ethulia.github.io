I'm Ming. I live in San Francisco and am interested in software and Internet culture. I was most recently Head of Product at [Lattice](https://www.lattice.com), and before that worked in engineering & product at [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com). Right now, I'm exploring some new ideas and doing some startup advising. 

**More from me online:**
- [Papertrail](https://www.papertrail.cc), a way to share and discover interesting things to read on the internet. Think Goodreads for articles.
- Emberconf 2016 Talk on [Learning Ember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiHlVVLOW2w)
