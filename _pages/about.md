I'm Ming. I live in San Francisco and am interested in startups, software, and Internet culture.

**Sideprojects:**
- This website!  
- [Papertrail](www.papertrail.cc), a way to share and discover interesting things to read on the internet. Think Goodreads for articles.

Other places that you can find me on the internet: [Twitter](www.twitter.com/ming), [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/minglu1), [Instagram](www.instagram.com/m1nglu).
